# Analyzing-wiki-clickstreams-with-pyspark
## Codecademy portfolio project

In this project, we’re going to continue working with Wikipedia’s open-source datasets. 
Wikipedia maintains a dataset called “Clickstream” that records clicks between pairs of linked Wikipedia articles. 
Because not all readers arrive at a Wikipedia article by clicking a link from another, 
the dataset also includes categories for clicks that originate outside of Wikipedia 
(e.g., external-search tracks all clicks coming from major search engines).
